# Board games AI

The goal of this project is to create on agent that can, given a board game rules, learn to play it
on expert level by cycles of self playing and model retraining, i.e. replicating an AlphaZero
algorithm.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.5
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Usage

The program can run in two modes: learning and custom play. Learning mode is for training the model
while custom play mode is for testing the model.

1. To use existing example run `$ python3 main.py`. It will start training a new model to play the
'four' game. Learning process will continue indefinitely until manually interrupted.
2. To test the model run `$ python3 main.py 1`. This will run an interactive playing session
between players defined in `play_custom()` function. Each player can be either human or AI.

Things worth noting about training process:
* A memory cache is saved each cycle and can be reused along with the model in future training
sessions
* A new version of the model is saved each time it succeeds its predecessor and can be reused in
future training sessions
* Model hyper-parameters and training parameters can be customized in `config.py`
* You can find the progress graph, logs, saved memory cache and model in `temp/` directory

## Adding a new game

Use `games/four/` directory as a reference. You'll have to implement `IGame` and `IGameState`
interfaces for the game rules, `INeuralNet` interface for the model, and `IPlayer` for the agent.
Let's go through each of them briefly.

* `IGame` is a static utility class. It contains a method for retrieving an initial game state and
a method for building symmetries of the board state. If there are no symmetries then it must return
a list containing a single (board state, pi) tuple. It also contains static game data like board
size and action space size.
* `IGameState` represents a current state of the game and contains methods responsible for making
turns and retrieving various state data.
* `INeuralNet` is responsible for creating the model, training it on given data, and inferencing.
* `IPlayer` represents an agent. Add your agent class to `players.py` and use `player_builder()`
factory for creating instances.

## Exporting a model

Configure the `utils/export.py` by setting the variables at the top of the file, then run it. The
`MODEL_VERSION` and `DIR_NUMBER` use the same conventions as described in `utils/paths.py`.
